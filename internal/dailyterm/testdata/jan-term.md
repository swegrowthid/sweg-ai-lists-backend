## Principle of Least Surprise

### Definition:

Principle of Least Surprise (also called Principle of Least Astonishment) is a design principle stating that a system should behave in a way that users expect, minimizing confusion and unexpected outcomes.

In simple terms: Things should work the way people naturally think they work.

**Why It Matters**  
When software violates this principle, users:

- Make mistakes more often
- Feel frustrated
- Take longer to learn the system
- Lose trust in the interface

### Examples:

Good (Follows POLS)

```
# Expected behavior - delete() actually deletes
def delete(item):
    item.clear()  # Actually removes the data
    return True   # Confirms deletion

user = {"name": "Alice"}
delete(user)
# User expects: user is deleted ✓
# Reality: user is deleted ✓
```

## Sieve Algorithm or Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Definition:

The Sieve Algorithm (specifically Sieve of Eratosthenes) is an ancient, efficient method for finding all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by systematically "crossing out" multiples of each prime, leaving only primes unmarked.

Key idea: Instead of testing each number individually, eliminate all non-primes in batches.

**Why It Matters**

- Fast: Much faster than checking each number individually
- Simple: Easy to understand and implement
- Efficient: Great for finding many primes at once (up to millions)

**How It Works (Simple Steps)**

- List all numbers from 2 to n
- Start with the first unmarked number (it's prime)
- Cross out all its multiples (they're composite)
- Repeat with the next unmarked number
- Continue until done

### Example:

Find all primes up to 30:

```
Step 1: List numbers 2-30
2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30

Step 2: 2 is prime, cross out multiples of 2
2  3  ✗  5  ✗  7  ✗  9  ✗  11 ✗  13 ✗  15 ✗  17 ✗  19 ✗  21 ✗  23 ✗  25 ✗  27 ✗  29 ✗

Step 3: 3 is prime, cross out multiples of 3
2  3  ✗  5  ✗  7  ✗  ✗  ✗  11 ✗  13 ✗  ✗  ✗  17 ✗  19 ✗  ✗  ✗  23 ✗  25 ✗  ✗  ✗  29 ✗

Step 4: 5 is prime, cross out multiples of 5
2  3  ✗  5  ✗  7  ✗  ✗  ✗  11 ✗  13 ✗  ✗  ✗  17 ✗  19 ✗  ✗  ✗  23 ✗  ✗  ✗  ✗  ✗  29 ✗

Step 5: Continue with 7, 11, 13...

Final Result (primes): 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
```

## AutoML Frameworks

### Definition:

AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) Frameworks are software tools that automatically handle the complex, time-consuming parts of building machine learning models. They automate tasks like data preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning.

Key idea: You provide the data, AutoML does the hard work, and you get a trained model.

**Why It Matters**

Traditional ML requires:

- Deep expertise in algorithms
- Manual feature engineering
- Trial-and-error for best parameters
- Hours/days of experimentation

AutoML provides:

- Automated model selection
- Works for non-experts
- Faster time to deployment
- Often better results than manual tuning

### Example:

```
from autosklearn.classification import AutoSklearnClassifier

# Just 3 lines!
automl = AutoSklearnClassifier(time_left_for_this_task=3600)
automl.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = automl.predict(X_test)

# AutoML automatically tried 100+ model configurations!
```

Popular AutoML Frameworks
| Framework | Description | Best For |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Auto-sklearn | Built on scikit-learn | Tabular data, Python users |
| H2O AutoML | Enterprise-grade AutoML | Business applications |
| Google AutoML | Cloud-based, no-code | Beginners, quick prototypes |
| TPOT | Uses genetic algorithms | Research, optimization |
| AutoKeras | Deep learning focused | Image/text data |
| PyCaret | Low-code ML library | Fast experimentation |
